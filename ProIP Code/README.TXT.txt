Dear reader,

I've made every attempt to ensure that the code in these chapters is complete and ready to compile; we've all downloaded code that didn't, however, so if you find that you hit any snags that aren't immediately obvious "DUH" moments on my part, feel free to drop me a line at the email address included in the beginning of the book and I'll see what I can do to help you out!

Also, for chapter 9, most of the snippets are designed to be run directly in the interpreter as interactive examples so I have only included the stand-alone scripts here since they are "fire and forget." 

Finally, the code related to plugins is written in C#, and the plugins themselves are written in IronPython. If need be, I would be happy to provide a plugin system in VB .NET; I'll perform that task as a function of demand if a lot of readers want it.

Regards,
Alan Harris
